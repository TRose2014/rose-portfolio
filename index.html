				<h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
				<div class= "half-width">
					<p>I currently reside in Seattle, Washington along with my growing family. I decided to enter the tech world after I had my daughter. I always knew I wanted to do something with computers but could never figure out what. Once she was born, I knew I wanted to make a better life for her and decided to do some research. That&#39;s when I found HTML/CSS and was instantly hooked!</p>

				<div class= "half-width">
					<p>Once I built my first website I knew that I would eventually obtain the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my new career. I would also have the ability to use my organizational skills and eye for detail to write clean code.</p>

					<h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
